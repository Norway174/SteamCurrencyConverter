Monitors your clipboard for any currency clips matching the Steam format.

Will use Google to convert. And display the result.

Currently hardcoded to convert to NOK.
That can be changed in the code.

Coded in VB.net using Visual Studio 2012 or newer required!
Great for a learning tool. And general utility.
Can easily be expanded upon and improved greatly.

All the code you'd really need to make this yourself, can be found in [SCC/Form1.vb](https://github.com/Norway174/SteamCurrencyConverter/blob/master/SCC/Form1.vb)

Feel free to do with this as you wish.
